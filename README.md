# Project 1 @cmda-minor-web Â· 2018-2019
## Jesse Dijkman

## Concept
My concept is a more fun way for kids to search books. I did this by combining svgs and fun interactions. 
The app starts with the search section, here you can add words and genres. When you hold the main potion down with your mouse the app will look for the data and display it in the next section.
The next step (which I didn't get to) is to get a detailpage and eventually show a (pirate) map to the selected book.
